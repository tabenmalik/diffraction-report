# Background
Diffraction is a beautiful phenomenon that causes iridescent lighting effects in materials.
Diffraction happens when a planar wave encouters an obstacle or a slit. As shown in figure (1),
the planar wave bends around the corners. This phonomenon is a property of any type of wave.
However, diffraction is generally talked about in terms of light. Light is a wave and will 
also bend around corners. If a slit decreases to a size comparable to the wavelength of light
then the "wave" becomes spherical. Another way to look at it is the slit becomes a point source
for the wave instead of a directional source.

Most of the diffraction we see in the world happens on materials that have many of the small
slits. Materials with many small slits are called diffraction gratings. Since every slit
becomes a point source of light, diffraction gratings create a series of point lights
close together. The combination of all of the waves causes interference, both constructive
and destructive, and a pattern emerges. As shown in figure 2, diffraction grating with multiple
wavelengths of light will cause peaks of wavelengths at different viewing angles. The intensity
of the light also falls off as the viewing angle is increased. This pattern is what we see when we
look at a CD or certain meats.
